# Data_Mining_1
The main objective of project is to perform Data Mining for gaining best insights on Data

------- PART 1 CLASSIFICATION -----------------

#About Data set
The data here discusses about the sports played from year 1896 to 2014 and the medals distributed to the athletes in those sports. 
More than 35,000 medals have been awarded at the Olympics since 1896. The IOC retrospectively awarded gold, silver and bronze to athletes based on their rankings.

#Findings and outcome from data:
The main objective of this project is to understand the data provided and find out which country has the most gold medals. 
What is the gender of the athlete that has won the medal? How has it changed over time?

#Steps Followed : 
>> Pre processing
>> Dividing in Training set and Testing Set.
>> Performing experiments.

# Experiments performed
>> J48 Tree using Training set and Testing set with confidence factor = 0.25, 0.4, 0.6.
>> Association Rules with significance level -2, -1 & 1.


-------------- PART 2 Clustering ---------------

#About Dataset
The data here discusses about the Banking, Debt, Financial, Inflation and Systemic Crises that occurred from 1860 to 2014 in African Countries. 
The data here focuses on 13 African Countries.

#Findings and Outcome from data
The main objective of this project is to understand the data provided and find out which factors are most associated with systemic crisis in Africa. 
Secondly, at which annual rate of inflation does an inflation Crisis become a practical certainty?

# Experiments Performed
>> K means Clustering with no. of clusters = 2,3,4
>> DBSCAN with epsilon(e) and minimum point(mp) = (e,mp) = (5,3), (7,4) & (10,6)
